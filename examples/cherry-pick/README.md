# cherry-pick

A mini GitHub clone demonstrating how to use [Cherrytree](https://github.com/QubitProducts/cherrytree) router with React.js.

It's work in progress, this is an initial version.

# Run locally

```
npm install
npm start
```

Now open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

Or open [http://localhost:8000/webpack-dev-server/bundle](http://localhost:8000/webpack-dev-server/bundle) to see the live reloading version of the app.

# TODO

- [ ] add a changelog tab that compiles changelog from commits + tags, filters merge commits
