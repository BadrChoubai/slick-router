- [x] convert example to webpack
- [ ] create a backbone example (the backbone-route workflow)
- [ ] create a react example
- [ ] unit test some of the stuff
- [ ] scenario test the router
- [ ] implement aborting/resuming transitions
- [ ] implement redirecting
- [ ] prove that redirects can be handled efficiently in the model middleware
- [ ] add a code example in the README
- [ ] update docs
- [ ] create cherrytree-for-backbone
- [ ] create cherrytree-for-react
- [ ] prove that all this works using mdashboard
- [ ] make sure transition and route descriptors are immutable (modifyng route descriptors only affect that transition)
- [ ] remove usage of the Backbone regexes and route matching, use the react-router Path code instead
- [ ] implement queryStrings
- [ ] add the size of the lib to README
- [ ] write a blogpost draft about the journey to 2.0 (sketchy bulletpoints)
- [ ] create examples folder where various middlewares are demonstrated
- [ ] make sure the route options are attached to the route descriptors in transitions
- [ ] prove that resolver middleware is possible
- [ ] proof of concept backend example
- [ ] make sure that joining patterns from routes is done correctly (the react-router way)
- [ ] make sure that qs parser can be overriden
- [ ] make sure splats works
- [ ] implement optional params / optional splats
- [ ] make consistent error reporting for checking invariants, etc.
- [ ] a function for listing all possible routes (leaf routes with their patterns)
- [ ] check if we still need `update` hook...
- [ ] handle matchPoint computation + annotating what changed in each route (previouslyActive | paramsChanged, queryParamsChanged)
- [ ] lower level createRoute function that takes location, qs and Promise implementations as params and this way avoids pulling them in as dependencies
- [ ] avoid pulling in when or lodash (location-bar is fine, install Promise as npm dep)
- [ ] support CJS and AMD... (will need to do smth about qs)
- [ ] detect noop transitions
- [ ] rename abort to cancel
- [ ] make sure router errors are logged loudly
- [ ] make sure handler errors are logged loudly (i.e. errors from the dispatchHandlers)
