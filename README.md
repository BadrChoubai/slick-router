Cherrytree is an awesome hierarchical stateful router for JavaScript applications.

It's build on top of [tildeio/router.js](https://github.com/tildeio/router.js) which is a micro library extracted from Ember. Cherrytree is based on Ember's own router, but is made to be independant of the framework and has a slightly different take on what a State is.

Cherrytree is AMD and a bower component.

TODO
 * docs
 * tests :-"
 * look into removing depdendency on underscore
 * look into submitting tildeio packages into bower
 * figure out if it's really useful to have State instead of just using handlers
